    <Paragraph>Measurements of morphological features were made at 50 x using a Leitz stereo microscope, with a dual-axis stage micrometer wired to Autometronics digital readouts. Measurements were recorded in thousandths of a millimeter, bur are here expressed to the nearest hundredth. Head measurements were made in full-face (frontal) view, as in Shattuck (1991</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Descriptive terminology employed here differs somewhat from that of Shattuck in the following particulars. I consider the ant head to be hypognathous rather than prognathous, so the vertex (see below) is dorsal and the mandibles are ventral. Mesosomal length (ML) is substituted for Shattuck's " alitrunk length or AL ". Ocular Index (OI) is an established term in ant systematics and is substituted for REL (Relative Eye Length). Instead of the morphologically incorrect " occiput " (as noted by Bolton, 1994</Paragraph>
