                        Amblyoponini
are distinctive. The petiolar tooth, in particular usually protrudes anteroventrally with the result that, in lateral profile, a notch-like incision is observed at its anterior junction with the sternum proper. Also compelling as synapomorphies are the specialized dentiform clypeal setae which appear to be unique to the tribe: the particular configuration of the metapleural gland which is not duplicated elsewhere: the shape of the petiole, which is rarely seen in other ants (

foraging habits and specialized as predators on arthropods, especially centipedes, living in soil or rolling wood (Brown, 1960</Paragraph>

                Adetomyrma

, an amblyoponine, has primitively loose abdominal segments, one must presume that fusion of segments 3 and 4 (and the differentiation of presclerites on the latter) in the 

                Amblyoponini
occurred independently of that seen in other poneroids. That these are homo-plasious characters is also suggested by a consideration of male morphology. The males of some

it becomes increasingly difficult to justify the monophyly of the

The characters, worker- and queen-based unless otherwise noted, are as follows: (1) dorsal cuticular flap of metapleural gland reduced anteriorly and extended posteromesally, so that metapleural gland orifice is directed more posteriorly than laterally (guard hairs usually common); (2) all castes: metacoxal cavities closed by a thin strip of cuticle (condition in
