    <Paragraph>Under both parsimony and Bayesian approaches the closeness of the two Leptanilloides species is confirmed, and there is unequivocal support (parsimony bootstrap 100 %, Bayesian posterior probability 1.00) for placement of Leptanilloides in the dorylomorph group (Figure 4). The parsimony analysis indicates that Leptanilloides is sister to all other dorylomorphs (bootstrap support of 72 %), but Bayesian inference places Leptanilloides as sister to (

    <Paragraph>present work) have produced results consistent with the hypothesis that the evolutionary history of ants involved an early diversification of poneromorph-like taxa, within which a second stronger radiation occurred that generated most of modern ant diversity (Figure 5). Highly specialized subterranean ants occur in both the early (“ basal ”) lineages and in various groups within the younger formicoid clade. This indicates that colonization of, and restriction to, the underground environment, with attendant convergence in morphology and behavior, has occurred on multiple occasions during ant evolution. Given the frequency of specialized hypogaeic species in lineages at the base of the ant phylogeny, the possibility could be entertained that these taxa reflect the ancestral condition for

, but this implies one or more transitions from subterranean to above-ground habits, which seems improbable. Moreover, epigaeic taxa are prevalent throughout the fossil record of ants, beginning in the Cretaceous (Grimaldi &amp; Agosti, 2000</Paragraph>
