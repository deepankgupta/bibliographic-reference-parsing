    <Paragraph>Counts of median fin rays, vertebrae, and predorsal bones were taken from digitally-scanned radiograph images ("x-rays")24. Measurements of standard length (SL), lengths from tip of snout to origins of dorsal, pelvic and anal fins, dorsal- and anal-fin bases, and dorsal- and anal-fin spine lengths of specimens not bent or otherwise distorted were calculated to the nearest tenth (0.1) of a mm from radiograph images25, and verified against measurements taken directly from specimens. All other counts and measurements were taken directly from specimens using a Fowler® Ultra-Cal IV 300-mm digital caliper. Measurement values were recorded to the nearest hundredth (0.01) of a mm, but rounded to the nearest tenth (0.1) of a mm for analyses. Methods of counts and measurements are mostly consistent with those described in Allen &amp; Randall (2004</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Total genomic DNA was extracted from available tissue samples using the Qiagen Dneasy® tissue kit following the manufacturer's protocol. In compliance with the Barcode of Life initiative, a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was amplified for holotypes (and some paratypes) of all species. Primers used for amplification and sequencing were BOL-F1 (5' TCA ACY AAT CAY AAA GAT ATY GGC AC 3') and BOL-R1 (5' ACT TCY GGG TGR CCR AAR AAT CA 3'), modified from Wa r d et al. (2005</Paragraph>

Chromis
species with XIII dorsal spines, a deep body (1.57-1.9 in S.L.), short snout (3.45-4.8 in head), and large eye (2.0-2.6 in head). Most counts are similar, and these two species appear to have more affinities with each other than with any other species in the genus. They can be readily distinguished from each other on the basis of color and by differences in general body shape (particularly the shape of the head profile, which is smoothly convex in
