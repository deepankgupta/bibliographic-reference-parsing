from the Canary Islands, which have differentiated into a minimum of five species (unpublished observations). Specific differences are best appreciated in the apterous queen caste, in the density and length of pilosity, shape of mesosoma, petiole and postpetiole, and biometry. In the apterous queens of the species from the Canary Islands a cline can be established in which the more dense the pilosity, the shorter is, and the more advanced are queens in the stage towards an ergatoid condition. Variation in pilosity is best appreciated in head profile, petiole and postpetiole in dorsal view. The most modified species is
