    <Paragraph>the mesopleuron was divided into upper anepisternum and lower katepisternum by a transverse groove. But this usage is not correct, because the groove is a secondary structure and not homologous with the paracoxal suture which separates the anepisternum from the katepisternum (Matsuda, 1970</Paragraph>
