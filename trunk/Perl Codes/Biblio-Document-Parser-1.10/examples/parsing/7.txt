<p>NOTES ON HETEROONOPS AND TRIAERIS<br>(ARANEAE; OONOPIDAE)</p>
<p>By Arthur M. Chickering<br>Museum of Comparative Zoology</p>
<p>In this short note are some additions and corrections to my pre-<br>viously published revisions.</p>
<p>Heteroonops spinimanus (Simon)<br>Figures 1-4</p>
<p>Oonops spinimanus Simon, 1891 : 563, fig. 6. The female holotype from St.<br>Vincent, B. W. I. is in the British Museum (Natural History). Simon,<br>1892: 445; 1893: 294; Petrunkevitch, 1911: 128; 1929: 67, figs. 53-57 ;<br>Gertsch, 1936: 8.</p>
<p>Heteroonops spinimanus, — Dalmas, 1916: 203, 217; Bryant, 1940: 205;<br>Roewer, 1942: 276; Bonnet, 1957: 2185; Chickering, 1969: 154, figs.<br>28-32.</p>
<p>I have been much interested in Heteroonops spinimanus (Simon)<br>for many years. Simon (1891) described the species from females<br>collected on St. Vincent, B. W. I. In 1892 he reported the species<br>from Venezuela. Dr. Petrunkevitch, in his study of Puerto Rican<br>spiders, (1929), stated that he had males and females for study in<br>the collection of the American Museum of Natural History. These<br>were collected in 1915 in San Juan, Cayey, Naranjito and Coamo<br>Springs. He regarded the males, taken in these localities, as belong-<br>ing with the females and described a male from San Juan as the<br>male of Oonops spinimanus Simon. This identification has been<br>widely accepted up to the present time. I have had the specimens<br>that were apparently studied by Dr. Petrunkevitch also on loan from<br>the American Museum of Natural History. It has been very dis-<br>appointing to find almost all of the specimens, believed to be those<br>studied by Dr. Petrunkevitch, in a very dismembered and almost<br>useless condition. I think there is no question about the status of the<br>females involved but I am obliged to regard the identification of the<br>males as open to serious doubts. Dr. Petrunkevitch noted a con-<br>siderable degree of variation among the males in respect to the<br>appearance of the palpal conductor and embolus, indicating, perhaps,<br>a mixture of species. I have spent much time in searching through<br>my extensive collection of Oonops for males which could be matched<br>with the well established females but without success. I am of the<br>opinion that the males identified as Oonops spinimanus Simon by</p>

<p>Records. In addition to the records cited above the following<br>should now be added in order to bring the record up to date: Dr.<br>Gertsch recognized the species from Florida in 1936, where it is<br>now known to be fairly common (Chickering, 1969). Miss Bryant<br>(1940) reported the finding of females in Cuba. I have taken many<br>females in the following localities during my collecting trips in<br>1954, 1957-1958, 1963-1964, 1965 and 1966: Jamaica, W. I. \where<br>the species seems to be abundant; St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix,<br>U. S. Virgin Islands; Puerto Rico, W. I.; St. Lucia. St. Kitts, Nevis<br>and St. Vincent, all in the British West Indies; Trinidad, W. I.;<br>Panama Canal Zone and parts of Panama, particularly in the<br>mountainous regions; and finally in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>1973]&nbsp;Chickering — Heteroonops and Triaeris&nbsp;229</p>
<p>The female, regarded by Miss Bryant as representing a new<br>species of Hytanis, was completely overlooked during my study of<br>the genus Triaeris (1968). At that time I believed that I had a<br>new species of the genus represented by a male from St. Croix, V. I.<br>Because of the close similarity of structure and coloration, I believed<br>that a female from Nevis, B. W. I., belonged with the male from<br>St. Croix, V. I. As a result of my examination of the holotype of<br>Hytanis pusilla Bryant I think it is logical to believe that this<br>female belongs with my male from the same locality and that it<br>represents a species of Triaeris. This leaves the status of the female<br>from Nevis in some doubt. This species may be a new one but I<br>am not yet certain about this. Further careful collecting among the<br>numerous West Indian Islands is obviously needed.</p>
