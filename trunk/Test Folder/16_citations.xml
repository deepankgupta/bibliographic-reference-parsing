    <Paragraph>Digital images (Fig. 1 - 17) were created using a JVC KY-F 75 digital camera and Syncroscopy Auto-Montage (v 5.0) software. All metric measurements were taken at 80 × power with a Leica MZ APO microscope using an orthogonal pair of micrometers and recorded to the nearest 0.001 mm and rounded to two decimal places for presentation. The accuracy of the micrometers was tested against a 0.01 mm microscope micrometer before and after measurements. Measurement indices and their abbreviations used in the paper are based on those used by Ward (1988</Paragraph>
