    <Paragraph>Given the natural history described above, it is difficult to imagine a biologically convincing scenario for regarding these ants as two forms of a single, panmictic species. It would be necessary to hypothesize that something about the environment of open-grown pines usually (but not always) causes a developmental shift that makes all members of a colony bicolored. Furthermore, this shift must not occur in colonies in relatively shaded pines, in open-grown hardwoods or in open-grown shrubs, vines and weed stems. While not utterly inconceivable, this scenario is complex and inherently improbable, especially given that there are no known examples of anything comparable occurring in the

. Likewise, we find the observations reported by Johnson (1988</Paragraph>

    <Year>1988</Year>
    <Offset>38014</Offset>
  </Citation>
  <Citation>
    <Paragraph>unconvincing as possible objections to regarding the two forms as good species. Johnson claims to have seen mixed foraging columns in overlap zones and says that colonies containing both color morphs have been found. In all our extensive collecting experience, we have never seen a single instance of either phenomenon. The rare occurrence of mixed colonies, however, is no serious impediment. Mixed colonies containing two non-parasitic ant species are not unknown, and they can be an accidental byproduct of territorial interactions in which nests are raided and brood stolen.

    <Paragraph>Prior to European settlement, much of the southeastern United States was covered with pine forests that were structured and maintained by frequent fires (Frost 1993</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>These forests might be on wet sites (flatwoods) or dry sites (sandhill) but they were similar in general structure, with a dense herbaceous ground layer and large, usually widely scattered pines, such as slash pine, P. elliottii, and longleaf pine, Pinus palustris. Shrubs and woody vines were suppressed by fire, but persisted in patches that were protected by natural fire breaks. The pines survived the fires by a series of adaptations, the most important of which (from an ant" s point of view) were the thick, loose layers of insulating bark at the base of the tree, thick twigs (which are less flammable than fine twigs), and the tendency for the lower branches and twigs to die and drop off, even when they receive plenty of light (thus reducing the chance that fire will be carried into the crown of the tree).

                        Crematogaster pinicola
appears to be specialized to endure frequent fires by taking advantage of the fire adaptations of pines. When the lower twigs and branches begin to senesce, they are quickly attacked by scavenging insects. At the Archbold Biological Station in central Florida for example, these are scolytids, such as Pityoborus comatus and Pityophthorus pulicarius and cerambycids, such as Eupogonius pauper. The activities of the beetle larvae provide a succession of thick hollow twigs where

can become established, even in young trees. Once established colonies gradually relocate up the trunk as branches die. As a tree matures, there are occasional dead twigs and branches up in the crown, and the buildup of thick layers of bark along the trunk provides another nesting area, especially where the outer bark is riddled with the abandoned galleries of moths. The creation of cavities in the bark by moths has been quantified by Tschinkel (2002</Paragraph>

Many birds show ephemeral specialization on single species of insects that are at a high point in a population cycle, but the red-cockaded woodpecker can afford persistent specialization because ant colonies themselves are abundant, long-lived, and available at all seasons. This ant revises the moral of Aesop" s fable of the grasshopper and the ant: the improvident grasshopper may vanish in the winter, but the thrifty and industrious ant can be eaten all year long!
