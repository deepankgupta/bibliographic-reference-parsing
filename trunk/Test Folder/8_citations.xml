However, the mesosomal profile is quite different, similar to that of the crassirugis group, the first gastral segment lacks enlarged punctures, and the erect hairs of the gastral dorsum are longer than in the eastern species. The frontal lobes are similar to those of

inhabits not only coniferous forest, but also mixed and rather open deciduous woods, from dry to more humid conditions. In Pennsylvania I found this ant in a stand of Populus with Acer and Betula trees. Colonies are small and their nests in different types of soil: sandy, earthy or rocky, under denuded surface or under leaf litter, lichens, mosses and rocks. Dennis (1938</Paragraph>
