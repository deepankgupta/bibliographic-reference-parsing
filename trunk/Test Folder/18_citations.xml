Forel remains one of the most unusual and enigmatic ant genera in the Old World. Most of the 17 described taxa are known from very few specimens, often single queens or males are collected during dispersal flights and occasionally workers are collected from dead wood. Forel (1911</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>Worker-queen intermorphs were present in low numbers among the series of workers. Two intermorphs exhibiting rudimentary wing articulations were present among 51 workers. Other intermediate stages of intermorph development were also present and this is consistent with the variation in development of ovarioles from six to two (Hoelldobler et al., 2002</Paragraph>

colonies were present in the same fallen tree (local Malagasy name “ Ompa ”). The colonies were separated by over 5 meters along the log and workers attacked and killed members of the other colony when put together into a common foraging arena. Workers and brood were found in chambers just below the log surface in close proximity to Cryptotermes termite chambers. Colony size was small, one colony containing less than 20 workers and about 40 larvae. A queen mesosoma along with worker remains was found in a refuse chamber of this colony. Since queens are known for this species it is probable that after the death of the primary reproductive, the colony is still able to produce workers via the presence of gamergates (Hoelldobler et al., 2000</Paragraph>
