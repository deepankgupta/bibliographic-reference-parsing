## Bibliographic Reference Parsing ##

Automatic recognition, parsing, and normalization of bibliographic references in any body of literature is tough. Building on the previous work like ParaCite Project we are developing algorithms, strategies, and code to enable highly accurate semi-automated markup of citations. This will not only help in enriching digital taxonomic literature, but would also prove to be a major contribution to many other digital library initiatives.

So the project will focus on the completion of the following goals :

# Study of existing literature.

# Formulation of parse rules.

# Coding the parser as an extension to [Project](ParaCite.md)

# Integration into TaxonX Schema and GoldenGate Editor.
